RBMB Clone - Serialization and Deserialization
Overview
This project is a clone of a Relational Database Management System (RBMB) that implements serialization and deserialization functionalities. Serialization refers to the process of converting objects into a format that can be stored or transmitted, while deserialization is the reverse process of reconstructing objects from the serialized format.

Serialization
Serialization is achieved by converting database objects, such as tables, rows, and columns, into a serialized format, often using JSON or binary formats. This serialized data can be stored in files, transferred over networks, or persisted in other storage systems.

Deserialization
Deserialization involves taking serialized data and reconstructing the original database objects from it. This process is essential for retrieving and using data that has been previously serialized, enabling the RBMB clone to work with data in various formats seamlessly.

Getting Started
To use the RBMB clone with serialization and deserialization features:

Clone or download the RBMB clone project repository.
Set up your environment and ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
Explore the serialization and deserialization modules within the RBMB clone to understand how data is converted and reconstructed.

Usage
Use serialization to save database state or transfer data between systems.
Use deserialization to load previously serialized data back into the RBMB clone.
Experiment with different serialization formats and strategies based on your requirements and performance considerations.

Contributing
Contributions to the RBMB clone project, including enhancements to serialization and deserialization functionalities, are welcome. Please follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the project repository.
